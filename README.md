The plugin will learn maps as they're played, and dump translatable content to `translations/_maps/<mapname>.txt`. Example:

```cpp
"Phrases"
{
	"edf566344eb9f2cb892e073e70c70181"
	{
		"en"		"Destroy the puppet"
		"es"		"Destroy the puppet"
		"ko"		"Destroy the puppet"
	}
}
```

You can then edit the text shown for that specific language code.

```cpp
"Phrases"
{
	"edf566344eb9f2cb892e073e70c70181"
	{
		"en"		"Destroy the puppet please it's scary"
		"es"		"Destruye la marioneta"
		"ko"		"꼭두각시를 파괴"
	}
}
```

Once this is set up, players will see messages in their preferred language if it exists. 

Some maps might require multiple playthroughs to be fully learned.

### ConVars

Configs are saved to `cfg/sourcemod/plugin.nmrih-map-translator.cfg` (Autogenerated when the plugin is first loaded)

- `mt_autolearn_langs` (Default: None) 
  - Space-separated list of language codes to include in the autogenerated files. For example `en es ko` would produce the file shown above.

- `mt_fallback_lang` (Default: "en")
  - Fallback language to show to clients whose preferred language has not been translated

- `mt_ignore_numerical` (Default: 1)
  - If set to 1, plugin won't attempt to translate and learn fully numerical messages (e.g. "9247")

### Commands

- `mt_bulk_learn_nmo` 
  - Forces the plugin to generate a translation file for every map on the server. The resulting files will only include objective messages. To learn game text and HUD hints the maps must be actually loaded.

### Requirements
- Sourcemod 1.11 Build 6646 or higher

### Notes

- Linux support is included but untested.
- This plugin is incompatible with [Multilingual Objectives](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2678257) and [Multilingual Objective Beta](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2305894).
